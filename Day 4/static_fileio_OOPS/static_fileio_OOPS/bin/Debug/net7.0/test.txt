1. Take this solution from Git Hub
2. Run and test the solution, it will work file
3. Add 3 classes to the application
	Savings
	Current 
	PF

	when user will create any account, accountNo will be auto generated for the accounts
	below are the sequence you need to follow

		Savings - accounts will start from 500 (500,501, 502, 503 etc....)
		Current - 2100 (2101, 2102, 2103, 2103 .....)
		PF - 7000 (7001, 7002, 7003 ...)


you will have 3 different files for all the 3 types of accounts

1. Use Inheritance
2. Use Polymprphism if possible (if you learned polymorphism just yesterday, then please code normally, it will take time thats ok
		once application runs well, implement polymorphism)
